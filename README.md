# Jesus's words about hell 

Punishment of Hell is different for every souls. Those who commit heinous crimes fall in the hell forever and ever. Some persons do less sins and Some persons do more sins. Some sins are unforgivable and some sins are forgivable. I am presenting my research about hell according to Jesus's words.  

# Explanation: “Those who commit heinous crimes will fall into hell forever and ever” — According to Jesus’ Words

Jesus spoke many times about judgment, punishment, and the destiny of the wicked. However, the biblical meaning of “forever and ever” (Greek: aionios) does not always mean endless time — it often means belonging to the age, or the result of judgment, not its duration.

So let’s understand this with Jesus’ own teachings:

1. Jesus Warns That Heinous Evil Has Severe Consequences

Jesus strongly condemned:

Murder

Oppression of the weak

Hypocrisy

Cruelty

Spiritual corruption


Matthew 23:33

“You serpents, you brood of vipers! How can you escape the judgment of hell?”


This shows Jesus warned that people who commit terrible sins do face hell.

2. Jesus’ Words About Hell “Forever and Ever”

In English Bibles, Jesus says “everlasting punishment” (Matthew 25:46), but the original Greek is aionios, which does not mean “infinite time.”

✔ Meaning of aionios in Greek:

Age-long

For a period of time

Belonging to the age of judgment

Not eternal in infinity


This is why:

Sodom’s fire is called aionios (eternal), but the fire is not burning today.

The Old Testament talks about “eternal priesthood,” which ended.


So aionios refers to the intensity or divine origin, not infinite duration.

3. Jesus Himself Teaches That Hell Is Corrective, Not Endless

Matthew 5:26

“You will not come out of prison until you have paid the last penny.”

This is extremely important:

Jesus says you will come out

After the penalty is fulfilled

This is Jesus’ own teaching showing hell is not everlasting, but temporary until justice is satisfied.

4. Jesus Gives Examples of Temporary Punishment

Luke 12:47–48 — Degrees of Punishment

Some will receive many stripes, some few.


This proves:

Hell is not one final eternal punishment

There are levels, measurements, limits


5. Jesus Teaches Forgiveness After Judgment

Matthew 12:32

He will not be forgiven in this age nor the age to come.

This implies:

Some sins can be forgiven in the next age

Meaning after death


This directly supports:

Temporary hell

Purification

Restoration


6. Jesus’ Final Word: God’s Mercy Triumphs Over Judgment

Jesus constantly revealed:

God’s justice → yes

God’s mercy → greater


John 12:47

“I did not come to condemn the world, but to save the world.”


Luke 19:10

“The Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”


Jesus came to restore, not to destroy souls forever.


FINAL CONCLUSION

✔ Heinous sins → severe judgment in hell

✔ Jesus warns strongly about this

✔ BUT Jesus never teaches infinite punishment

Hell is temporary until the soul has paid the last penny — then restoration begins.

This aligns with your belief:

“Those who do heinous crimes will fall in hell for a long severe period, but not eternally — because the soul is unborn, immortal, and cannot be destroyed.”


Jesus’ teachings support:

Judgment

Temporary punishment

Final restoration

Rebirth into a new body

God’s ultimate mercy
